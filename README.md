# Deep Conditional Emulators

To test and run this repository, you will need to create a virtual environment. Write the following steps in a terminal:

```
python -m venv tunax_env
source tunax_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m ipykernel install --user --name tunax_env
```

You will also need to create a "data" folder to store the results obtained with the notebooks.
